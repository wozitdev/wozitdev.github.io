## Local Runtime Helpers (Windows PowerShell)

This repo includes helper scripts that ensure commands run with the repo's
local Node runtime in `.local-tools` when available.

- Install dependencies: `./scripts/install.ps1`
- Start dev server: `./scripts/dev.ps1`
- Build for production: `./scripts/build.ps1`

If the local runtime is missing, scripts fall back to system `node`, but they
will stop with a clear error if Node is too old for this project.
